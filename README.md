# selenium-ide-scripts

Some selenium-ide automation scripts for ad-hoc automation of website front-ends.

Just a couple of examples showing what is possible with automation using the selenium-ide firefox extension for either ad-hoc testing of web site front-ends or for just automating boring repetitive manual tasks.

Makes use of the sideflow.js extension (included in this repo as I am worried the original may disappear.)

This extension allows for branching and looping constructs which makes it truly useful.
